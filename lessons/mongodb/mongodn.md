# MongoDB Notes
In mongoDB, data is stored in BSON format. BSON is a binary representation of JSON-like documents. It is a lightweight, traversable, and efficient format for storing data.

Data is stored in collections, which are analogous to tables in relational databases. Each collection contains a set of documents, which are analogous to rows in relational databases.

So we have: __Database__ -> __Collection__ -> __Document__ -> __Key-Value Pairs (Fields)__
